# dnd-simulation

This repository contains primarily exploratory simulations, focused in addressing several common dichotomies facing the Dungeons and Dragons player.

These questions include:
* should a character use a shield, or two-hand their weapon?
* should a character use a greatsword (more consistent, average damage) or a greataxe (more variable damage), given the presence or absence of certain abilities
