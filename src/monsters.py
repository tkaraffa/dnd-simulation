"""
Utility functions for randomly generating
the statistics of a Monster class object.
Only a CR is provided on initialization - every function which is used during
object construction uses this integer value to create a normally-distributed
random variable and uses it to select an integer value that can then be
used by the Monster object.

def _choose_value(cr: int, options: list, factor: int = 1, scale: int = 1):
    """
    Prototypical function for choosing values based
    on CR. Choose a rounded, triangularly-distributed value
    that is roughly centered on CR, and index the ordered options with
    that value to produce an output.
    Bottom value is bounded by either 0 or CR - 5
    Top value is bounded by either CR + 5 or max index of options
    Mode is the scaled CR, which is obtained by dividing the CR
    by the maximum CR (20) and multiplying by the maximum value of
    the distribution (the length of the list of options).
    With the above parameters, as CR increases, so does the mode, and
    potentially the bottom and top bounds.
    E.g., with input options = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], a higher CR will
    more often produce an index of [6], which corresponds to
    a value of 3. A lower CR will more oftten produce an index
    of [0], which corresponds to a value of 1. A CR of 20 will
    have bounds (5, 6, 6), which will most often result in returning
    an index of [6], and the corresponding value of 7.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cr: int
        The mean of the normal distribution
    options: list
        Ordered list of choices for the output
    factor: int
        The scaling factor to divide the normal RV by before
        rounding to get the index - higher generally results in
        a lower final value
    scale: int
        The standard deviation of the normal distribution
